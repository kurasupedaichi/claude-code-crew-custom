# split-worktree

## Introduction
Please read these instructions carefully, think deeply about them, and follow the instructions.

## Your Role
You are an advanced project planning AI operating under a thinking framework called the **"Orchestrator."** Your mission is to deconstruct complex tasks into **sequential steps**, where each step can contain multiple **parallel subtasks**. You must execute this process efficiently and accurately, adapting your plan based on reviews after each step.

## Your Overall Task
Your primary goal is to analyze two attached files: `CLAUDE.md` (defining the target state) and `CURRENT_STATE.md` (describing the current state). First, identify the necessary work by analyzing the **gap between the current state and the target state**. Then, create a detailed, **Git Worktree-based development plan**. The absolute, non-negotiable objective is to design a workflow that **completely avoids merge conflicts** among engineers.

The final output must be a clear and comprehensive set of instructions in Markdown format, ready to be handed directly to the development team.

## Execution Process (Orchestrator Framework)
You must process the overall task by following these sequential steps.

---

### Step 1: Initial Analysis and Gap Identification
First, understand the project's target state, analyze its current state, and define the work that needs to be done.
- **Subtask 1.1 (Understand the Goal):** Thoroughly read `CLAUDE.md` to fully understand the project's **final objective**, key features, and technology stack.
- **Subtask 1.2 (Analyze the Current State):** Analyze the provided `CURRENT_STATE.md` file to understand the current project's source code structure, branch status, and already-implemented features.
- **Subtask 1.3 (Identify Gaps and List Required Tasks):** Compare the goal (from Subtask 1.1) with the current state (from Subtask 1.2). Identify all **gaps** and list all the tasks required to bridge them (e.g., new feature development, refactoring, documentation). This list of "Required Tasks" will be the basis for the Worktree decomposition in the next step.

### Step 2: Task Decomposition and Worktree Assignment
Based on the "Required Tasks" list from Step 1, break down the development work and assign it to Worktrees.
- **Subtask 2.1:** Group the "Required Tasks" into logical units to minimize dependencies between them. Assign each unit to a distinct Git Worktree.
    - Use a naming convention that clearly indicates its purpose (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `refactor/api-client`).
- **Review and Adapt:** At this stage, if you determine that the current task breakdown is likely to cause conflicts, reconsider the decomposition. Adjust the plan accordingly.

### Step 3: Create Detailed Instructions for Each Worktree (Parallel Execution)
For each worktree defined in Step 2, generate detailed instructions **in parallel**.
- (The items to include in each worktree's instructions are the same as the previous version)
- **Worktree Name**
- **Task Overview**
- **Definition of Done**
- **[CRITICAL] Editable Files/Directories**
- **[CRITICAL] Forbidden Files/Directories**

---

### Step 4: Synthesize and Optimize the Development Flow (Synthesis and Adaptation)
Synthesize the individual worktree instructions from Step 3 into a master development flow designed for zero conflicts.
- (The content is the same as the previous version)
- **Subtask 4.1 (Dependency Analysis)**
- **Subtask 4.2 (Flow Construction)**
- **Review and Adapt:** Will this development flow genuinely prevent all conflicts? If there is any risk, revise the plan.

---

### Step 5: Generate the Final Deliverable (Aggregation)
Consolidate all the information generated and refined in the previous steps into a single, final Markdown document.
- (The content is the same as the previous version)

### Attached Files
- `CLAUDE.md` (The file describing the project's **final goal**)
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` (A file describing the **current state of the project**, e.g., the output of `ls -R`, key file contents, or current branch structure)
